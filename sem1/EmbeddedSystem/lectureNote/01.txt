Embedded system design constraints
1. cost
2. performance ( required operations / time deadlines )
3. size/weight
4. power/energy
5. Environment ( temperature , ... )


deal with power issue
- deal with modules/logics/IO

security : prevent attacks
safety : maintain stable state


real-time system
1. Hard real-time
	must occur within the required deadline
2. Soft real-time
	function correctly if deadlines are occasionally missed
3. Firm real-time
	soft real-time system + no benifit from late delivery of service

A single system may have all types of real-time subsystems.

dealing with missing deadline => use cost function
