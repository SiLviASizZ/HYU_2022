in DFA, 2 states are indistinguishable ( in same DFA )
when....
q1 => ( w ) => FINAL STATE OR NOT
q2 => ( w ) => FINAL STATE OR NOT

q1 q2 합칠수있음

distinguishable => 합칠 수 없음
( distinguishable by a string w )


how to show indistinguishable ? ( quite hard )

- set as if all of states are indistinguishable
- divide sets if some states are distinguishable
	- w = lambda , then 0 , then 1 ( following C )



1. Delete states that are no approachable frome Initial state
2. Use Reduction Method
