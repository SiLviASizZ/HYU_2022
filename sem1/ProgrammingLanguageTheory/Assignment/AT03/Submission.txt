prob 1. 2.
valu v , pattern p => p matches v

match produces a " list of string * valu pairs "
order in the list does not matter


- Wildcard : matches everything and produces the empty list of bindings
- Variable s : matches any value v and produces the one-element list holding (s,v)
- UintP : matches only Unit and produces the empty list of bindings
- ConstP 17 : matches only Const 17 , and produces the empty list of bindings
- TupleP ps : matches a value of the form Tuple vs , if ps and vs have the same length and for all i
- Constructor P (s1, p) matches Constructor (s2, v) if s1 and s2 are same string, and p matches v. The list of bindings produced is the list from the nested pattern match.
