Semantics for pattern - matching
takes : pattern p , value v , if 1 match -> 2 match -> what variable bindings are introduced ?

patterns can nest

i.e.
Pattern
a:;b::c::d => matches all lists with >= elements
a::b::c::[] => matches all lists with 3 elements
((a,b),(c,d))::e matches all non-empty lists of pairs of pairs


Exception bindings
raise primitive raises an exception
=> Alike datatype constructors

nothing left for caller to do => f x is immediate result  =>  f x is a tail call
