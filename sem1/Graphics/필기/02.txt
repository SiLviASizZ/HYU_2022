Version : python 3.7

Numpy
python module, fast vector/matrix operations

Transpose / Reshape : Order of Elements is Different

What I learned
1. using numpy ( simple operators )
2. Vector(1d) & Matrix(2d) with NumPy ,  we use Matrix multiplication ! ( np.dot = @ )
3. OpenGL ( API , not a library )

Quiz
Direction of Dimension ( ↓dim1 , →dim2 ) , looks like [a,b] on python interpreter , but it is actually [1, k] shape, so it can be multiplied
